2. **Use strong passwords** (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
3. **Create unique usernames** for each person
4. **Assign appropriate roles** based on job function
5. **Regular cleanup** - remove users who no longer need access
6. **Monitor access** through the admin panel

### User Naming Conventions:

- Use clear, identifiable usernames
- Consider format: `firstname_lastname` or `firstname_role`
- Avoid special characters that might cause issues
- Keep usernames professional

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Username already exists"**

- Choose a different username
- Check existing users in the admin panel

**"Password must be at least 6 characters"**

- Use a longer password
- Include mix of letters and numbers

**"Access denied: Admin privileges required"**

- Only admin users can manage other users
- Login with an admin account

**"Database connection error"**

- Ensure MySQL is running
- Check database credentials in `.env` file
- Verify Prisma migrations are up to date

### Getting Help:

1. Check the admin panel for existing users
2. Verify server is running on port 5000
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Review server logs for backend issues
